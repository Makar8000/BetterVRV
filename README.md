A suite of improvements to the VRV player


## Features
- [x] no-spoilers: Hide potential spoilers in the thumbnails and descriptions.
- [ ] seek-controls: Better seeking control from the keyboard; JKL, arrow, and adjustable increments.
- [ ] volume-controls: Adjust the volume and mute/unmute.
- [ ] speed-controls: Adjust the playback speed.
- [ ] skip-op: Skip the opening sequence.
- [ ] skip-ed: Skip the end sequence and bring up the "next episode" prompt sooner.

## Roadmap
* skip-previw: similar to no-spoilers, skip or do not show the prievew at the end of episode
* subtitle-settings
* force-HD
* skip-recap: if there is a recap that contains no new content, skip it
* user-markup: allow users to submit timestamps/flags for skip parameters (and obviously report them as well)
* tie-settings: ties settings to account or system-wide
* unblock-loading: prevent the loading status from blocking the ui
* skip-title: option to include or exclude the title card (if any) from the skip-op settings
* new-op-only: option to play openings and endings all the way through when they are new/different from the series/the first time they appear or have changed
* fp-improvements: move "continue watching" to the top of the front page, don't show shows you are up to date with in continue watching
* show-by-show: per-show settings?
* learn-skips: ask users if they are willing to have their skipping/pausing habits shared anonymously to try to glean skip sections without manually marking
