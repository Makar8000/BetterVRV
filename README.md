Roadmap
---
* subtitle-settings
* force-HD
* skip-recap: if there is a recap that contains no new content, skip it
* user-markup: allow users to submit timestamps/flags for skip parameters (and obviously report them as well)
* unblock-loading: prevent the loading status from blocking the ui
* skip-title: option to include or exclude the title card (if any) from the skip-op settings
* new-op-only: option to play openings and endings all the way through when they are new/different from the series/the first time they appear or have changed
* fp-improvements: move "continue watching" to the top of the front page, don't show shows you are up to date with in continue watching
* show-by-show: per-show settings?
* learn-skips: ask users if they are willing to have their skipping/pausing habits shared anonymously to try to glean skip sections without manually marking
