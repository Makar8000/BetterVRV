Last thing to do is remove the contorl blocking from the loading spinner


Currently two features don't work and need fixing:
    hideLoadingPoster: there is a very brief flash that i cannot get rid of
    showControlsOnShortcut: does not properly show controls, instead if they are hidden, it hides the minified progressbar
